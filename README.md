# titanium-classicui

A theme UI built for Project 1999 (_Titanium_) to look like the classic 640x480 interface.

This is mostly programmed by faBBe and dualentity. Some minor tweaks & fixes need to be done.

## Installation

- Place "classic" folder in "__(_eq game path_)/uifiles__" folder.
- Go in game and open "__Options > Display > Video Modes__", and change your display size to 640x480.
- In game, use the command "__/loadskin classic 0__".
- In game, use the command "__/viewport 119 0 400 320__".
- Press I to open inventory and make the persona icon appear.
- Until the spellbook button works, use CTRL+B or "/book" to open the spellbook.
