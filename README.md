# titanium-classicui

A theme UI built for Project 1999 (_Titanium_) to look like the classic 640 x 480 interface.

This is mostly programmed by faBBe and dualentity. Some minor tweaks & fixes need to be done.

## Installation

- Place "classic" folder in "(_eq game path_)/uifiles" folder.
- Go in game and open Options > Display, and change your display size to 640x480.
- In game, use the command "/loadskin classic 1".
- In game, use the command "/viewport 119 0 400 320".
- Press I to open inventory and make the persona icon appear.
- Until the spellbook button works, use CTRL+B or "/book" to open the spellbook.
