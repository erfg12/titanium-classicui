# titanium-classicui

A theme UI built for the EverQuest Titanium game client to look like the classic 640x480 interface.

This is mostly programmed by faBBe and dualentity. Some minor tweaks & fixes need to be done. Currently the Project 1999 server is an issue since patch version 50d.

## Installation

- Place the "__classic__" folder in the "__(_EQpath_)/uifiles__" folder.
- Go in game and open settings (ALT + O) "__Display > Video Modes__", and change your display size to __640x480__.
- In game, use the command "__/loadskin classic 0__".
- In game, use the command "__/viewport 119 0 400 320__".

## Alternative Installation

- Copy "__UI_CharName_P1999.ini__" to your "__(_EQpath_)__" and replace "CharName" with your characters name.

## Notes

- Press I to open inventory to make the persona icon appear.
